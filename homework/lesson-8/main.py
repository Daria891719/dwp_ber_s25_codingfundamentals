"""Homework L8: Dictionaries ðŸ“š
We have the list of tuples:

european_cities = [("Istanbul", [15460000, "Kebab", "Hagia Sophia"]),
                   ("Moscow", [12678079, "Borscht", "Red Square"]),
                   ("London", [8982000, "Fish and Chips", "Big Ben"]),
                   ("St. Petersburg", [5383890, "Blini", "Hermitage Museum"]),
                   ("Berlin", [3669491, "Currywurst", "Brandenburg Gate"]),
                   ("Madrid", [3348536, "Paella", "Royal Palace of Madrid"]),
                   ("Kiev", [2884000, "Borscht", "Saint Sophia's Cathedral"]),
                   ("Paris", [2140526, "Croissant", "Eiffel Tower"])]
Create an empty dictionary: european_cities_info
Loop over the european_cities and unpack each tuple
Print dictionary with the format City --> [Population, Dish, Landmark]
Sort the european_cities_info dictionary alphabetically by city (use sorted)
Safely print the 'Berlin' info from the european_cities_info dictionary
Safely print the type of 'London' from the european_cities_info dictionary
Safely print 'Barcelona' from the european_cities_info dictionary or 'Not Found'
Add new city ("Rome", [2870500, "Pasta", "Colosseum"])
Remove "Madrid" from european_cities_info
Check to see if Amsterdam is in european_cities_info and print whether it is there or not
Bonus: Create a dictionary from two lists:
Use the functions dict() and zip()
dishes = ["Pizza", "Sauerkraut", "Paella", "Hamburger"] countries = ["Italy", "Germany", "Spain", "USA"
